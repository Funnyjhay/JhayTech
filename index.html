            The coordinator wanted to take the minute but a member of the house raised an observation that the minute be read by another executive present since the secretary is not on sit. This observation was seconded by an LOC member. The minute was read by the financial secretary. 
            Nwankwo Jonathan raised some observations concerning the minute read; he corrected that NFCS is Nigeria and not Nigerian as it was written in the read minute. He pointed out a few typographical errors and also observed that code of conduct wasn’t read. He also added that the minute wasn’t duly signed.
            Stephen Adeyemi added that he was present at the last meeting and both the minute and code of conduct was unavailable and that’s why it wasn’t read.
            The coordinator gave reasons for not signing the minute as the secretary being sick.
            Omofoma Victor asked if the coordinator is sick too because her signature wasn’t tendered either. The coordinator apologized for everything Odeyemi Mathew suggested the minutes be signed by the coordinator and acting secretary at the minute. He was seconded by Adeniji Francis.
